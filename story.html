                <h2 class="story-subheading">A Childhood of Cricket, Music, and Performance</h2>
                <p class="story-paragraph">
                    My childhood was shaped by a passion for cricket and a love for good food. During my school years, I was actively involved in various performing arts, playing multiple musical instruments in the orchestra for annual functions and leading morning prayers on stage. I also enjoyed participating in dramas for special occasions like Dussehra and Independence Day. My friends from school were a mix of good friends who stood by my side and those who didn't. This period of my life also taught me valuable lessons about resilience after a serious accident forced me to stop playing cricket.

                <p class="story-paragraph">
                    After completing my tenth grade, I moved to Kota to prepare for the JEE Mains competition. Despite taking a year to prepare, I was unable to secure a seat at an IIT. This was a challenging time, but it led me to an important new chapter: my admission to SRMIST in Kattankulathur, Chennai. The journey from my home in Rajasthan to Tamil Nadu was an adventure in itself, filled with many ups and downs, including my personal battle with weight. I've gained a lot and lost a lot, both literally and figuratively, but every experience has taught me something valuable.

                <h2 class="story-subheading">My Time at SRMIST</h2>
                <p class="story-paragraph">
                    Studying at SRMIST has been a truly transformative experience. My final year, in particular, has been a deep dive into the core subjects that form the backbone of computer science.
                </p>
                <p class="story-paragraph">
                    Through subjects like **Data Structures & Algorithms**, I learned to think critically about problem-solving efficiency. The concepts of **DBMS** and **Computer Networks** have given me a solid foundation in how data is stored, retrieved, and transmitted securely across the internet. I've also had the opportunity to build practical projects in **IoT** and **Machine Learning**, which have been pivotal in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world applications. These experiences have not only built my technical skills but also taught me the importance of collaboration and continuous learning.

                <p class="story-paragraph">
                    Hostel life has been a big part of my college experience, full of memorable moments like celebrating Holi with crackers inside the hostel, shouting after cricket matches, and doing other unnecessary but fun things. I even put together a cricket team and led us to the finals of an inter-college tournament. These experiences have been about more than just academics; they've been about building friendships and making lasting memories. I have a close-knit group of friends in class who, despite always sitting in the last row, are incredibly studious and dedicated. We often take part in competitions and challenges together, supporting each other along the way. Throughout my college journey, I've had many ups and downs with my weight and my friendships, but every experience has taught me something valuable. It has been a time of personal growth and finding the people who matter most.

                <p class="story-paragraph">
                    As I approach the end of my academic journey, I'm now fully focused on preparing for placements. I'm working hard to cover all the ground I missed in the first three years of college, and I'm confident that my journey has prepared me to tackle any challenges that come my way. This portfolio is just the beginning of my professional story, and I'm looking forward to what comes next.
